                        After this step, you‚Äôll land on your <strong>Dashboard</strong> ‚Äî the central place where all
                        your work is organized:

                        example, a paper project might have a goal for the initial draft and another for revisions based
                        on reviewer feedback.

                        Each goal is broken into <strong>Milestones</strong>: smaller, trackable steps. These can be
                        created manually or generated using AI, depending on your plan.
