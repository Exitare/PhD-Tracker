                This tool was created by a PhD student who experienced firsthand how overwhelming the academic journey can be.
                With endless deadlines, scattered resources, and no streamlined way to set or track milestones, staying organized was a constant struggle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tools like OneNote, Notes, and spreadsheets helped for a while—but they quickly became cluttered, disjointed, and difficult to manage across projects.
                There was no single space where academic progress could be visualized and aligned with long-term goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's why this tracker was born. It's a purpose-built solution designed to bring structure to the chaos,
                helping researchers focus less on managing the mess and more on making meaningful progress.
