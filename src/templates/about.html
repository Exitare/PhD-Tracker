                    PhD Tracker by AnoBrain began as a personal side project by <a href="https://www.exitare.de">Raphael
                    Kirchgaessner </a>, a published PhD student who, like many others, found himself lost in a maze of
                    deadlines, disorganized documents, and scattered goals. None of the existing tools met the needs of
                    a researcher managing complex academic progress across multiple fronts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Driven by this frustration, Raphael built the first version of the tracker to bring structure,
                    clarity, and focus to his own workflow. Over time, the tool evolved—refined, expanded, and
                    battle-tested through the real-world rigors of a PhD journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What started as a solution to a personal pain point soon attracted the interest of colleagues,
                    labmates, and fellow academics. Their enthusiastic feedback and ongoing feature requests sparked a
                    bigger idea: why not make this available to the entire academic community?
                </p>
                <p>
                    And so, PhD Tracker by AnoBrain was born—not just as a tool, but as a mission: to empower researchers at
                    every stage of their journey with smart, intuitive software built by someone who’s walked the path.
