                My Academic Tracker began as a personal side project by <a href="https://www.exitare.de">Raphael Kirchgaessner </a>, a published PhD student who, like many others, found himself lost in a maze of deadlines, disorganized documents, and scattered goals. None of the existing tools met the needs of a researcher managing complex academic progress across multiple fronts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Driven by this frustration, Raphael built the first version of the tracker to bring structure, clarity, and focus to his own workflow. Over time, the tool evolved—refined, expanded, and battle-tested through the real-world rigors of a PhD journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                What started as a solution to a personal pain point soon attracted the interest of colleagues, labmates, and fellow academics. Their enthusiastic feedback and ongoing feature requests sparked a bigger idea: why not make this available to the entire academic community?
            </p>
            <p>
                And so, My Academic Tracker was born—not just as a tool, but as a mission: to empower researchers at every stage of their journey with smart, intuitive software built by someone who’s walked the path.
